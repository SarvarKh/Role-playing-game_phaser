# Hunter - Phaser 3 game

> This is a Hunting video game built with Javascript and the game engine Phaser.

## About The Project
2D Hunting game running only on browsers and built with Phaser 3. The player's job is to try to avoid a enemy attacks. So the player should keep smashing them as they get in close ranges. The main objective of the game is to keep the enemies at a distance and smash any that gets closer to the player. If more enemies appear in close range to the player, they overwhelm and defeat you.

For each enemy you smash, points will be added to your score. In the end, you will be added to the leaderboard if you come out among the best.
